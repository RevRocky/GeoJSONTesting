1. INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPTIMIZED VIEWING

To improve clarity, it is recommended to hide objects with a ZN_STATUS value of "5" in the ZONING_ZONE_CATAGORIES (Zoning Area) feature, as these are not part of Zoning By-law 569-2013.

HOLDING_ID (Holding Number if it exists.)
FRONTAGE = (The required minimum Lot Frontage in the zone, and is a numeric value prefaced by the letter "f" within a residential zone label.) [Unit = metres.]

ZBL_CHAPTR = (By-law text chapter number)
ZBL_SECTN = (By-law text section number)
ZBL_EXCPTN = (By-law text section number)
